    <p> The People Behind the Project: Driving Local Revitalization

Who We Are

 KARU HOME was established in 2025 by a collective of local community leaders, academics, and technologists who recognized that vacant housing data was scattered and inaccessible. We are a volunteer-based, non-profit group focused entirely on improving the quality of life and fostering investment in Karatina.

Our Origin Story

We started after a local neighborhood watch meeting highlighted the detrimental effect of just a few abandoned homes on property values and safety for the entire block. We realized that the first step to fixing the problem was simply knowing where the problems were. This website is the result of that initial insight: making data transparent and actionable.

Our Vision for Karatina

Our long-term goal is measurable: to see the number of long-term vacant and distressed properties in our community reduced by [Target Percentage, e.g., 35% within the next five years]. We believe in proactive, data-driven solutions that lead to stable neighborhoods and increased opportunities for homeownership for everyone.

Thank you for being part of the solution.</p>

    <p> Simplified Solutions: Access Data, Report Blight, and Find Resources


Our platform is built around three core services designed to make engaging with vacant properties straightforward and effective.

1. The Vacant Property Locator

This is your real-time, interactive map and search engine. We aggregate fragmented public information into one easy-to-use tool.

Verified Data: Each listing includes public details such as the Parcel Identification Number (PIN), approximate address, last known utility status, and links to the County Assessor for official ownership records.

Powerful Filters: Easily sort properties by key criteria like Zoning Classification, Property Type (residential, commercial), and Condition Rating (low, moderate, or severe distress).

2. Citizen Reporting Tool

Your eyes on the ground are critical to our success. We rely on community observations to identify newly vacant or neglected homes.

Quick Submission: Use our confidential form to report a location, upload photos, and add notes on the property's condition (e.g., overgrown lawn, broken windows).

Confidentiality: All reports are submitted anonymously. We never share your identity. Our team validates your report against public records before it appears on the map.

3. Rehabilitation Resource Library

Finding the property is just the first step. We connect you to the local support needed to succeed.

Financial Resources: Direct links to state and local programs, including grants for first-time buyers, low-interest rehabilitation loans, and historic preservation tax credits specific to Karatina.

Legal & Zoning Guidance: Simple-to-understand guides on navigating local zoning ordinances, requesting permits, and understanding the legal process for acquiring distressed property.</p>

    <p>Our Commitment to Transparency and Responsible Data Use


Trust is the foundation of our work. We maintain strict policies regarding data accuracy and user privacy.

Data Sourcing and Verification

The information on this website is compiled from reliable public sector sources:

Official Records: Data is primarily sourced from the Karatina Tax Assessor’s Office, City Code Enforcement Records, and Public Utility Disconnection Notices.

Accuracy: Official records are updated on a monthly basis. We note the "Last Confirmed Vacant Date" on every property listing to ensure transparency.

User Privacy and Confidentiality

We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what is strictly necessary to run the site.

We do not sell or share user data with third parties for marketing purposes.

The Citizen Reporting Tool is confidential. Your contact information is never shared or linked to a property record.

Ethical & Legal Guidelines (Crucial Disclaimer)

This website is an informational service only and is not a substitute for professional counsel.

No Trespassing: Listing a property on our map does not grant any user the right to enter, inspect, or trespass on the property. All local laws regarding private property must be respected.

Due Diligence: We strongly advise all users to consult with a licensed real estate professional, title company, and legal counsel before attempting any transaction related to a property found on this site.</p>
